## Framing (5 minutes / 0:05)

**What is an API?**

> Basically, an API is a service that provides raw data for public use.

API stands for "Application Program Interface" and technically applies to all of software design. The DOM, jQuery, and React are actually examples of APIs! Since the explosion of information technology, however, the term now commonly refers to web URLs that can be accessed for raw data.

Many APIs publish data for public use. As third-party software developers, we can access an organization's API and use their data within our own applications.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Why do we care?</strong></summary>

  > Why recreate data when we don't have to? Think about past projects or ideas that would be easier if you could pull in data already gathered elsewhere.

  > APIs can provide us with data that would we would otherwise not be able to create ourselves.

</details>

As we move into building single page applications, now is the perfect time to start understanding how to obtain data on the client side and then render it on the browser.

### Think, Pair, Share (5 minutes / 0:10)

Form pairs and explore the API links in the below table. Record any observations that come to mind. In particular, think about what you see in the URL and the API response itself.

| API | Sample URL |
|-----|------------|
| **[This for That](http://itsthisforthat.com/)** | [http://itsthisforthat.com/api.php?json](http://itsthisforthat.com/api.php?json) |
| **[Giphy](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)** | [http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC](http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC) |
| **[OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/)** | [http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Game%20of%20Thrones&Season=1](http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=Game%20of%20Thrones&Season=1) |

### Why Just Data?

Sometimes that's all we need. All this information, from all these browsers and all these servers, has to travel through the network. That's almost certainly the slowest part of the request cycle. We want to minimize the bits. There are times when we just need the data. For those times, we want a concise format.   

### What is Serialized Data? (10 minutes / 0:20)

All data sent via HTTP are strings. Unfortunately, what we really want to pass between web applications is **structured data** (i.e., arrays and hashes). Thus, native data structures can be **serialized** into a string representation of the data. This string can be transmitted and then parsed back into data by another web agent.  

There are **two** major serialized data formats...

#### JSON

**JSON** stands for "JavaScript Object Notation" and has become a universal standard for serializing native data structures for transmission. It is light-weight, easy to read and quick to parse.

> Remember, JSON is a serialized format. While it may look like an object, it needs to be parsed so we can interact with it as a true Javascript object. 

_Unparsed_
```text
{"users":[{"name": "Bob", "id": 23},{"name": "Tim", "id": 72}]}
```

_Parsed_
```json
{
  "users": [
    {"name": "Bob", "id": 23},
    {"name": "Tim", "id": 72}
  ]
}
```


#### XML

**XML** stands for "eXtensible Markup Language" and is the granddaddy of serialized data formats (itself based on HTML). XML is fat, ugly and cumbersome to parse. Thankfully, JSON has mostly eliminated the need to ever use XML. You'll probably always favor using a JSON API, if available.

```
<users>
  <user id="23">
    <name><![CDATA[Bob]]></name>
  </user>
  <user id="72">
    <name><![CDATA[Tim]]></name>
  </user>
</users>
```

**Many APIs publish data in multiple formats, for example...**

* [http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/json?symbol=AAPL](http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/json?symbol=AAPL)
* [http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/xml?symbol=AAPL](http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/Quote/xml?symbol=AAPL)

**AGAIN, ALWAYS CHOOSE JSON WHEN YOU CAN**

## Where Do We Find APIs? (5 mins)

APIs are published everywhere. Chances are good that most major content sources you follow online publish their data in some type of serialized format. Heck, [even Marvel publishes an API](http://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started). Look around for a "Developers" section on major websites.

**That sounds hard. Can't you just give me a freebie?**

Try the [Programmable Web API Directory](http://www.programmableweb.com/apis/directory), [Mashape](https://market.mashape.com/explore) or the [Public APIs Directory](http://www.publicapis.com/).

## You do
Spend 10 minutes exploring these APIs and post some of the interesting data sets to the classroom channel in Slack.

## What Is An API Key? (5 minutes / 0:25)

While many APIs are free to use, many others require an API "key" that identifies the developer requesting data access. This is done to regulate usage and prevent abuse. Some APIs also rate-limit developers, meaning they have caps on the free data allowed during a given time period.

**Try hitting the [Giphy](https://api.giphy.com/) API...**

* No key: [http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat](http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat)

* With key: [http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC](http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/search?q=funny+cat&api_key=dc6zaTOxFJmzC)

**It is very important that you not push your API keys to a public Github repo.**

> This is especially true when working with [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/). Here's an example of a [stolen key horror story](https://wptavern.com/ryan-hellyers-aws-nightmare-leaked-access-keys-result-in-a-6000-bill-overnight).

## AJAX (5 minutes / 0:30)

**So we know what an API is. Now what?**

How can we use an API to dynamically manipulate the DOM with the given data? **AJAX**. As you'll come to learn, this allows us to build single page applications that do not require refreshes.

**AJAX**, which stands for "Asynchronous Javascript and XML," is the method through which we are able to make HTTP requests. The standard requests we will be making are `GET` `POST` `PUT` `PATCH` and `DELETE`.

| Type of Request | What's It Do? | An Example URL |
|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| `GET`  | Read | [http://swapi.co/api/planets/](http://swapi.co/api/planets/) |
| `POST` | Create | [http://swapi.co/api/planets/](http://swapi.co/api/planets/) |
| `PUT` | Update | [http://swapi.co/api/planets/2/](http://swapi.co/api/planets/2) |
| `PATCH` | Update | [http://swapi.co/api/planets/2/](http://swapi.co/api/planets/2) |
| `DELETE` | Delete | [http://swapi.co/api/planets/2/](http://swapi.co/api/planets/2) |

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: Why do you think there is a "2" at the end of the URLs in the last three rows? (Hint: you could replace it with any number)</strong></summary>

  > You'll notice that the URLs for `PUT` `PATCH` and `DELETE` end with a number. That's because these actions are updating or deleting a *particular* student. That number is a unique identifier for a particular student defined on the back-end. More on this next week...

</details>

## Break (10 minutes / 0:45)

## GET Data From an API Using AJAX

### I Do: GET From OMDB (15 minutes / 1:00)

> **Do not follow along for this portion of the lesson.** You will have the opportunity to do it yourself later.

Let's build a very simple app that posts a movie title and poster after searching for it. We'll do this using the [OMDB API](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

The starter code is linked above. It contains a basic HTML/CSS/JS setup. If you open up the HTML in the browser, you will notice that searching for something returns no results.

Let's go ahead and add in the AJAX request. There are many ways to write an AJAX request, but we will be using a library called `axios` during this class.  Axios is a Promise-based HTTP client that takes advantage of many new JavaScript features and uses JavaScript's built in Promise API.  Let's see it in action now.

```js
// Get value from search input field.
const keyword = document.getElementById("#keyword").value;
const url = `https://www.omdbapi.com/?t=${keyword}&apikey=d31f1a94`;
axios.get(url).then(response => {
  console.log(response);
});
```

Three important things to notice about `axios` here...
  1. The method called is `.get()`.  We can also use `.post()`, `.put()`, `.delete()`, and more.
  2. The `.get()` method only takes one argument. The url of the api we want to hit.
  3. We can tell axios what to do with the data by calling `.then()`.

<details>

  <summary><strong>Q: How did we know which URL to use?</strong></summary>

  > The [OMDB API documentation](http://www.omdbapi.com/)

</details>

### Promises

After making an API call, we need to let our program know what to do with the data when it comes back. We can do this by doing something with the its return value, which comes in the form of a **promise**. We can use **promise methods** to tell the `axios` request what to do if the request is successful or not. We will use two promise methods when working with Axios...

#### `.then()`

`.then()` is called whenever the previous method returns information.  In the case of AJAX calls, this typically means that `.then()` will be called once the information has been requested, processed, and sent back to our program.  We use `.then()` to tell our program what to do with this JSON data.   

```js
axios.get(url).then(response => {
  var data = response.data
  document.window.append(data);
});
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: What are we passing into the `.then` promise method? Does this remind you of anything we've done previously in class?</strong></summary>

  > `.then` requires a callback that determines what we do after a successful AJAX call. This is an example of a higher order function

</details>

#### `.catch()`

A promise method for when the AJAX call fails.  These failures can occur for a variety of reasons. Internet went down, url is incomplete, the server you're hitting running into errors... it's important to know why things go wrong when they do.  That's why the catch method allows you to catch and interpret errors when they occur.

```js
.catch(function (error){
  console.log("fail");
  console.log(error)
});
```

### BREAK

## Making API Calls in a React Application.

Through the use of AJAX and axios, we allow our React app to communicate with servers to retrieve and insert information.  Since we are using AJAX, we can update our database and get information back from the server without ever having to refresh the browser.  Let's build an application that communicates both with the Giphy API and with an Express API deployed on Heroku.

### Strange Things
Giphy is home to some weird stuff... we're going to create a React app that allows users to save and rank the strangest gifs that Giphy has to offer as well as explore random gifs being sent by their API

#### APIS
We're going to using 2 APIs for this app:
**[GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/)**
**[Strange-Things-API](https://strange-thing-api.herokuapp.com/api)**

#### Set Up
Let's start out by cloning some starter code. The starter code is generated from `create-react-app` but has some additional styling, fonts, and includes axios.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/ATL-WDI-Exercises/react-ajax
  cd react-ajax
  yarn #Or npm install 
  yarn start #Or npm start
```

If everything installed correctly, you should see a `Hello World!` page.

#### Designing our Component Structure
Before we start writing components, let's think about what our app is doing and how we should properly design it.  Here is a basic wireframe of our app.

![](http://imgur.com/GxpiM6o.png)

#### You Do: (5 min)
Work with the students around you to and discuss how many different React components we need for this application.  What would you name each of these components?

#### Getting gifs from our Heroku API
Let's start out by building the React component that will retrieve and render information about the gifs that are available on our API that is already deployed on Heroku.

```jsx
// ./components/SavedGifts.jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class SavedGifs extends Component{

  render(){
    return(
      <h1>Hello From SavedGifs!</h1>
    )
  }
}

export default SavedGifs;

// ./App.js
// Remember to import your new component in App.js
import React, {Component} from "react";
import SavedGifs from './components/SavedGifs';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <img className="backgroundImg" src="http://i.imgur.com/DysM91b.png"/>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <SavedGifs />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

We should now see `Hello From SavedGifs` in our UI.  Now we are ready to use axios to give us data from the server.  

#### Retrieving Data on Load

We want axios to make an API call whenever React is ready to mount the `SavedGifs` component.  Think back to our previous lesson on the React Component Lifecycle, what special method would be able to do this for us? 

`componentWillMount` will allow us to initiate an API call and `setState` whenever the data gets back. Let's add that to our `SavedGifs` component.  We'll walk through this process step-by-step.

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
// Step 1: Import axios
import axios from 'axios';

class SavedGifs extends Component{
  // Step 2: Set your state to contain a property called 'savedGifs'
  state = {
    savedGifs: []
  };

  // Step 3: Call 'componentWillMount' for making your API call
  componentWillMount(){
    // Step 4: Use axios.get to retrieve all saved gifs from our API
    axios.get("https://strange-thing-api.herokuapp.com/api")
         // Step 5: Save the response array to this.state.savedGifs
         .then((response) => {
           const savedGifs = response.data.strangeThings;
           this.setState({savedGifs: savedGifs});
         })
         .catch((error) => {
           console.error("Error: ", error);
         });
  }

  render(){
    // Step 6: Use '.map' to loop through this.state.savedGifs and save a variable with the jsx for all of your gifs.  Finally, refer to this variable within the return statement.
    const savedGifs = this.state.savedGifs.map((gif, i) => (
      <div className="gif" key={i}>
        <img src={gif.url} />
        <div>Score: +{gif.strangeness}</div>
      </div>
    ));

    return(
      <div className="savedGifsContainer">
        <h3>Previously Saved Gifs</h3>
        <div className="savedGifsFlexContainer">
          {savedGifs}
        </div>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

export default SavedGifs;

```

Let's hop back into our browser and we can see that we successfully retrieved and rendered all of the gifs and the scores associated with them.

#### You Do: (30 min)
Create another component called `RandomGif.jsx` and build a component that will retrieve and display a random gif generated from the Giphy api.
  * Look at the wireframe above to determine where to put the component in the UI
  * The URL you will be calling is `http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random`
    * Use the [GIPHY Documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/#random-endpoint) to figure out what request parameters you are required to send.
    * Use the [axios Docs](https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios) to figure out how to send request params when making a `.get()` call.
  * Remember you are only going to show one gif (hint: you don't need to do a `.map()` with the info you get back)
  * If the request fails, log "FAIL" in the JavaScript console.

### POST and PATCH

The next thing we want to build for our app is a thumbs up and thumbs down button within `RandomGif` that will save a gif if we click thumbs up and will generate a new gif after we click.

First, let's create the events whenever a user if a user clicks thumbs up or down
```js
// ./components/RandomGif.jsx
...

  componentWillMount() {
    this._getRandomGif();
  }

  // Event to be attached to thumbs down.
  _disapprove = () => {
    this._getRandomGif();
  }

  // Event to be attached to thumbs up.
  _approve = () => {
    // Prepare the response that you are posting to the API
    const payload = {
      url: this.state.gifUrl,
      strangeness: 1
    };

    // Use axios.post() and target the Heroku API and send the payload defined earlier
    axios.post(this.props.url + "/api", payload).then((res) => {
      // Get a new gif once the post is successful
      this._getRandomGif();
    });
  }

  // Move the axios.get to it's own function to DRY up the code.
  _getRandomGif = () => {
    return axios.get("http://api.giphy.com/v1/gifs/random", {
      params: {
        api_key: "SECRET_API_KEY",
      }
    }).then(res => {
        this.setState({
          gifUrl: res.data.data.image_original_url
        });
    });
  }

...
```

Now that we have our actions defined, let's create elements in our jsx that can trigger the events.

```js
...

render(){
  return(
    <div>
      <img className="randomGif" src={this.state.gifUrl}/>
      <br />
      <div className="thumbs">
          <i onClick={this._disapprove} className="fa fa-3x fa-thumbs-down"></i>
          <i onClick={this._approve} className="fa fa-3x fa-thumbs-up"></i>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

...
```

**HOLD ON** Let's go back and look at the wireframes.  It looks like the thumbs up/down are also used in the saved gifs part of the app.  This is a great opportunity to refactor the thumbs up/down into their own Component.

```js
// ./components/Thumbs.jsx
const Thumbs = (props) => {
  const { disapprove, approve } = props;

  return (
    <div className="thumbs">
      <i onClick={disapprove} className="fa fa-3x fa-thumbs-down"></i>
      <i onClick={approve} className="fa fa-3x fa-thumbs-up"></i>
    </div>
  )
}
export default Thumbs;

// ./components/RandomGif.jsx
...
render() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img className="randomGif" src={this.state.gifUrl}/>
      <br />
        <Thumbs approve={this._approve} disapprove={this._disapprove} /> 
    </div>
  );
}
...
```

<details>
  <summary><strong>Q: What are some other ways to acquire data in the client?</strong></summary>

  > Adding input fields and forms.

</details>

### You Do: PATCH (30 min)

Now that you've seen me POST new gifs to the API, you will now write a PATCH that will increase or decrease the strangeness score by 1 every time the user clicks thumbs up/down.
  * Use the `Thumbs` component we used before
  * Create an `approve` and `disapprove` method within the `StoredGifs` class.
  * Make an Axios request that will trigger a `patch` to `https://strange-thing-api.herokuapp.com/api/:id`


Since you will all be modifying the same API, **please only update gifs that you yourself have created!**

#### Bonuses

* If you haven't already, make it so that a successful `GET`, `POST`, or `PATCH` request re-renders the all gifs' score in the browser to reflect the API.
