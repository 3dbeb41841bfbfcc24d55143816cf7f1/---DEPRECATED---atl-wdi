# Styling in React

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*
- Understand the philosophies behind bringing CSS into the JS component
- Use the `styled-components` to build styling components
- Create basic animations within JavaScript Styles
- Distinguish between various CSS frameworks available in React

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*
- Build a basic UI using React and JSX
- Understand CSS properties and transitions
- Identify various CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap, Material, Foundation)

So far in React, we have used JS and HTML to break our project into small, reusable components.  

-- Instagram clone
-- Why do we want to avoid separate css files?
  -- Everything is a global variable. Or add processors
  -- CSS logic (!importants, cascading, complicated naming) allows many unnecessary side effects.
-- But the Separation of Concerns!
-- CSS Modules
-- Styled-components? 
  -- Show nesting and pseudoselectors
  --
-- React-Animations
-- Frameworks
  -- Material UI
  -- React-Bootstrap
  -- React-Foundation
-- What’s the point? If you’re writing React, you have access to a more powerful styling construct than CSS class names. You have components.
