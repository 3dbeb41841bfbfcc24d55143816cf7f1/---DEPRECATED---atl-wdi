                <p>Description: Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo is a 1984 film directed by Sam
             Firstenberg. It is a sequel to the 1984 breakdancing film
             Breakin'. Electric Boogaloo was released nine months after its
             predecessor by TriStar Pictures and by Cannon Films a few months
             later. In some international locations the film was released under
             the title Breakdance 2: Electric Boogaloo. Another sequel, Rappin'
             (also known as Breakdance 3) was made but had an unconnected plot
             and different lead characters â€“ only Ice-T features in all three
             movies.</p>
