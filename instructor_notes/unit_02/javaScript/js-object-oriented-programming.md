# Object Oriented JavaScript and Classes

## Learning Objectives

  - Explain the importance of OOJS 
  - Describe the role of ES2015 Classes and how they work 
  - Use the `new` keyword to create objects with shared properties
  - Create a class that inherits from another using the `extends` and `super` keywords

## Framing(10 minutes / 0:10)

We've already gotten exposure to JavaScript objects using object literal notation (i.e., the curly brackets). You might have created an ATM object like this:

```js
let savingsAccount = {
  balance: $(".balance"),
  withdrawButton: $(".withdraw"),
  amount: 0,
  withdraw: function(deduction){
    this.amount -= deduction;
    balance.text(this.amount);
  }
};
```

What's nice about the above code snippet? How does it compare to this...

```js
  let balance = $(".balance");
  let withdrawButton = $(".withdraw");
  let amount = 0;
  let withdraw = function(deduction){
    amount -= deduction;
    balance.text(amount);
  }
```

#### How have we been writing code up until this point ?

We have been writing **procedural code**, which basically means we are writing and executing code as we need it. We'll define some variables and functions here, maybe some event listeners there. We end up with a lot of separate pieces that contribute to the overall functionality of an application. This goes against the idea of keeping our code DRY, short for _Don't Repeat Yourself_. 
  
What do we do when we want to go beyond reusing a value which may just be a primitive or an object containing some key/value data? What if we want to clone an object that has _behaviors_ we seek to reuse?

For example, say we are developing a revamped version of the video game Street Fighter. Each character may have their own unique fighting tricks, but in general, all character objects should have at least the same kick and punch abilities. With DRY in mind, when we develop a new fighter object we know we would want to avoid recreating any of these general behaviors and instead code a solution that clones them. We can most easily solve this problem by following patterns driven by Object Oriented Programming.

#### What is an object in programming ?

  An object encapsulates related data and behavior in an organized structure.

#### Why might we use an OOP approach to programming ?

Object-oriented programming(OOP) provides us with opportunities to clean up our procedural code and model it more closely to the external world.

OOP helps us to achieve the following...
  * **Abstraction:** Determining essential features 
  * **Encapsulation:** Containing and protecting methods and properties 
  * **Modularity:** Breaking down a program into smaller sub - programs

OOP becomes **very** important as our front-end code grows in complexity. Even a simple app will have lots of code on the front-end to do things like...
  * Send requests to a back - end to fetch / update / destroy data 
  * Update the state of the page as data changes 
  * Respond to events like clicking buttons

### Creating Objects(5 minutes / 0: 15)

So far, we've had to make our objects 'by hand' (i.e. using object literals)...

```js
var celica = {
  model: 'Toy-Yoda Celica',
  color: 'limegreen',
  fuel: 100,
  drive: function() {
    this.fuel--;
    return 'Vroom!';
  },
  refuel: function() {
    this.fuel = 100;
  }
}

var civic = {
  model: 'Honda Civic',
  color: 'lemonchiffon',
  fuel: 100,
  drive: function() {
    this.fuel--;
    return 'Vroom!';
  },
  refuel: function() {
    this.fuel = 100;
  }
}
```

Even though we're technically using objects to organize our code, we can see a noticeable amount of duplication. Just imagine if we needed a hundred cars in our app! Our code would certainly not be considered "DRY".

As you may have noticed, some of these properties change between cars(`model` and `color`), and others stay the same.For example, `fuel` starts at 100, while the `drive` and `refuel` functions are the same for every car.

Making all of these similar objects by hand is just tedious. What
if we could build a function that makes them for us?

### You Do : Create a `makeCar` Function(10 minutes / 0: 25)
> 5 minutes exercise.5 minutes review.

Define a function `makeCar` that takes two parameters - `model` and `color` - and returns an object literal representing a car using those params.

```js
// This should return a car object just like the previous example
var celica = makeCar("Toy-Yoda Celica", "limegreen");
```

<details>
  <summary> <strong>Solution...</strong></summary >

```js
  // ES5
  function makeCar(model, color){
    return {
      model: model,
      color: color
    }
  }
```

```js
  // ES6
  let makeCar = (model, color) => {
    return {
      model, //ES6 shorthand for model: model
      color  //ES6 shorthand for color: color
    }
  }
```

</details>

This is the basic idea behind OOP: we define a **blueprint** for an object and use it to generate multiple instances of it!

## Classes

### Overview(10 minutes / 0: 35)

It's so common that we need to make objects with similar properties and methods that programming languages usually have some features to help with this.

In JavaScript, ES6 provides a feature called **classes** to accomplish this. A class serves as a **blueprint** for instantiating new objects.

Let's take a look the following `Car` class:

```js
class Car {
  constructor(model, color){
    this.model = model;
    this.color = color;
    this.fuel = 100;
  }
  drive(){
    this.fuel--;
    return "Vroom!";
  }
  refuel(){
    this.fuel = 100;
  }
}

const celica = new Car("Toy-Yoda Celica", "limegreen");
const civic = new Car("Honda Civic", "lemonchiffon");
```

Classes work a lot like the `makeCar` function we just created, but they're supported by JS and we use the `new` keyword to generate instances of an object (just like our earlier `celica` and `civic` examples).

> Note that classes start with a capital letter to make it obvious that they are classes.This isn't necessary, but is a convention you should follow.

### I Do: Make a Person Class(10 minutes / 0: 45)

```js
class Person {
  // We use the constructor method to initialize properties for a class instance.
  // It takes whatever arguments we want to pass into an instance.
  constructor(initialName){
    this.name = initialName;
    this.species = "Homo Sapiens";
  }
  // We define any methods accessible to an instance outside of the constructor
  speak() {
    return `Hello! I'm ${this.name}`;
  }
}

const andy = new Person("Andy");
andy.speak(); // "Hello, I'm Andy"
```

#### `this`

Notice the use of `this`, and the fact that we don't return from the class. Here's why we write classes this way...

When we generate a class instance using `new`, JavaScript will automatically...
  1. Create a new, empty object for us  
  2. Generate a context for that object (`this` -> the new object)
  3. Return the object  

#### Where are the Commas?

Unlike object notation, you do not need to use commas when separating class methods.

### You Do: Make an ATM (20 minutes / 1:05)

For this exercise you will be creating an ATM class.

It will have the following properties...
* `type` (e.g., "checking"), which should be determined by some input
* `money`, which should start out as `0`

It should have the following methods...
* `withdraw`, which should decrease the amount of money by some input
* `deposit`, which should increase the amount of money by some input
* `showBalance`, which should print the amount of money in the bank to the console.

The `Atm` class has a `transactionHistory` property which keeps track of the withdrawals and deposits made to the account.
* Make sure to indicate whether the transaction increased or decreased the amount of money in the bank.

#### Bonus

Give the `Atm` class a `backupAccount` property that can, optionally, contain a reference to another instance of the class, determined by some input
* Whenever an ATM's balance goes below zero, it will remove money from the instance stored in `backupAccount` so that its balance goes back to zero.
* This should trigger a withdrawal in the back up account equal to the amount of money that was withdrawn from the original account.

## Break (10 minutes / 1:15)

## Inheritance (15 minutes / 1:30)

Although OOP can help us keep our Javascript nice and clean, it's still easy to duplicate code when defining multiple classes. Consider the following example...

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(name, breed, tail) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.waggingTail = tail;
    this.diet = [];
  }
  eat(food) {
    this.diet.push(food);
    console.log(this.diet);
  }
  bark() {
    return `Bark! Hello, this is dog. My name is ${this.name}`
  }
}

class Cat {
  constructor(name, breed, numLives) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.numLives = numLives;
    this.diet = [];
  }
  eat(food) {
    this.diet.push(food);
    console.log(this.diet);
  }
  meow() {
    return `Meow! I am not a dog! My name is ${this.name}`
  }
}
```

Here we have two classes: `Dog` and `Cat`. They have some things in common: `name`, `breed`, `diet` and `eat`. They do differ, however, in that one `bark`s and the other `meow`s.

Imagine that we had to create a number of other classes - `Horse`, `Goat`, `Pig`, etc. - all of which share the same aforementioned properties but also have methods that are particular to the class.

How could we refactor this so that we don't have to keep writing out the shared class properties and methods. Enter **inheritance** (think genetics, not money from your rich uncle)

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.diet = [];
  }
  eat(food) {
    this.diet.push(food);
    console.log(this.diet);
  }
}

const dog = new Animal("Fido", "Beagle");
```

Here we've defined an `Animal` class. It contains the properties and methods that are common among specific animal classes. Wouldn't it be nice if `Dog` and `Cat` could just reference this "parent" `Animal` class so that the only things we need to put in their "child" class definitions are the properties and methods that are particular to them (e.g., `bark`, `meow`).

Lucky for us, we can do that...

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(name, breed) {
    this.name = name;
    this.breed = breed;
    this.diet = [];
  }
  eat(food) {
    this.diet.push(food);
    console.log(this.diet);
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed, tail) {
    this.waggingTail = tail;
  }
  bark() {
    return `Bark! Hello, this is dog. My name is ${this.name}`
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed, numLives) {
    this.numLives = numLives;
  }
  meow() {
    return `Meow! I am not a dog! My name is ${this.name}`
  }
}
```

The clincher is `extends`. Whatever class is to the left of the `extends` keyword should inherit the properties and methods that belongs to the class to the right of the keyword. Let's see if this works...

```js
// Let's test out our parent. It just needs a name and breed.
const goat = new Animal("Gregory", "Mountain Goat");

// And now the children.
const fido = new Dog("Fido", "Beagle", true);
console.log(fido); // "this is not defined"
```

That didn't work out the way we expected. That's because we're forgetting one thing. When creating an instance of a child class, we need to make sure it invokes the constructor of the parent (`Animal`) class.

We can do that using the keyword `super()`

```js
class Dog extends Animal {
  constructor(name, breed, tail) {
    super(name, breed);
    this.waggingTail = tail;
  }
  bark() {
    return `Bark! Hello, this is dog. My name is ${this.name}`
  }
}

const fido = new Dog("Fido", "Beagle", true);
```

`super()` calls the constructor of the parent class. In the above example, once `super` does what it needs to do in the `Animal` class, it then runs through the rest of `Dog`s constructor.

> In order to give an instance of a child class context (i.e., be able to use `this`), you must call `super`.

> If the keyword `super` is confusing, think of a supervisor to understand that we're calling out to the next level above us (to the parent class's constructor).

## You Do: Inheritance (20 minutes / 1:50)

### Create a `User` class.

It should have the following properties...
* `username`, determined by some input
* `password`, determined by some input

It should have the following methods...
* `changePassword`, which allows a user to change his password to some other string

### Create an `Admin` class.

It should inherit from `User`. An admin has the same properties and can run the same methods a user can.

It should also have the following properties...
* `accessLevel`, which is an arbitrary integer determined by some input

It should also have the following methods...
* `overridePassword`, which should take another user and a new password as an argument. When executed, this method changes the password for the passed-in user.

### Bonus I
> Try implementing a class feature we won't be covering in class.

Create a "getter" and "setter" methods for retrieving and updating a user's `username`.
