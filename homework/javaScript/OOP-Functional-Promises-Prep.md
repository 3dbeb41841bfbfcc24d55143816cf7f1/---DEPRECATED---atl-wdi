# Prepping for the Big One

Tomorrow, we will be discussing several abstract concepts. Some of these are specific to JavaScript and some are more generic across all programming languages.  This has consistently been one of the most difficult days of the cohort.  Tonight's optional homework will help prepare you for many of these new concepts, and make tomorrow's content much more digestible.

Here are some hand picked resources that will serve as a good introduction to these concepts:

### Why Does Object Oriented Programming Exist?
  This blog post from [Invent With Python](https://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/02/why-is-object-oriented-programming-useful-with-a-role-playing-game-example/) is an excellent intro to why Object Oriented Programming exists and cleans up code.
  **Note:** This tutorial is written in Python, but the concepts stay true regardless of programming language.
  **Also** when you see references to something called a Dictionary, that is the same as an Array in JS.

### Using the `class` keyword in JS
  [Letâ€™s Learn ES6 - Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUtZRwA7Fqc) is about a 15 minute long video that shows exactly how to declare and use an ES6 class.

  The first 5-6 minutes shows how JS developers utilized OOP using Prototypal Inheritance.  While this is good to know what is happening behind the scenes, it is not required that you understand exactly what the `.prototype` operator is doing.

### Functional Programming
  [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMUiFMZr7vk&list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) has a video series on functional programming with plenty of codealong examples.  He is a little erratic, but the content is great.  The first 5 videos on Higher Order Functions, `.map`, `.reduce`, and closures should be the most valuable for now.

### Promises
  For promises, it is most important to understand WHY we use promises, the scenarios in which we will use a promise, and how to consume a promise.  Don't spend too much time focusing on creating a Promise from scratch.
