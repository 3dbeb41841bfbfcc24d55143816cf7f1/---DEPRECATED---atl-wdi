# Homework : Practicing Promises with NodeSchool

For tonight's homework, you'll be going through a [NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/#workshopper-list)
tutorial called [Promise It Won't Hurt](https://github.com/stevekane/promise-it-wont-hurt).

## Exercise Objectives

- learn how to write and resolve promises
- gain more practice with the Command Line Interface (CLI) in terminal
- use `promise-it-wont-hurt`'s built in tests to check your work

## Setup

To set up and install the platform, run `npm install -g promise-it-wont-hurt`.
Then, create a new blank file inside _this directory_ called `program.js`. You will be completing the exercises in this file.

## Directions

Attempt the following 7 exercises in order from the promise-it-wont-hurt tutorials:
  - Warm up                                   
  - Fulfill a promise                     
  - Reject a promise
  - To reject or not to reject
  - Always asynchronous
  - Shortcuts
  - Promise after promise

Feel free to attempt the others if you get the chance, but it begins to dive into concepts that we have not covered yet.

> Challenge: Hints are provided for you in the tutorial on the bottom half of each prompt. See if you can complete the exercise without the help of the hints!

Each time that you start a level, in `program.js` write a comment indicating which level your
code is for. Then, comment out code from any previous steps.

When you complete a level, make a commit, and use the name of the
exercise (i.e. "STATIC") somewhere in the subject of your commit message.

- Make sure you properly installed promise-it-wont-hurt with `npm install -g promise-it-wont-hurt`. The `-g` ("global") tag means this package is installed globally in your machine and you can execute `promise-it-wont-hurt` from any directory.

- Check your work by running the built in test `promise-it-wont-hurt verify program.js`. Read the comments to help you find the error.

- Make sure you save `program.js` before executing the test

### Testing Your Work

Promise-it-wont-hurt, just like all NodeSchool tutorials, comes with really handy built-in tests that
you can use to check your work. To run these tests, navigate into the directory
where `program.js` can be found and run `promise-it-wont-hurt verify program.js`.
Promise-it-wont-hurt will show you whether or not your code is working, and if it isn't,
it will give some reasons why.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're ready, push the code to your fork on GitHub submit a link to the repo on Schoology.
The submission should have:

-   A link that points back to your fork.

-   A 'comfort' score on how you feel about the material, from 1 (very
    uncomfortable) to 5 (very comfortable)
