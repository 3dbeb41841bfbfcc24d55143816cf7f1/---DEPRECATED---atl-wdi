_First there was Identity, then Supremacy, then Ultimatum, then Legacy. Now it's time for Agent JSON Bourne to tackle his toughest challenge yet..._

# The Bourne Asynchronicity!

Use your freshly-honed AJAX skills to help Agent Bourne complete a high-stakes reconnaissance mission into the depths of cyberspace. Clone this repo, then complete as many missions as you can...

## Mission One

Your task is to retrieve an item from the storage unit located at https://api.myjson.com/bins/1680y. When you return to HQ, you will need to log details of your retrieval attempt in the console.
  - If your attempt fails, please log the nature of your error. Then try again.
  - When your attempt succeeds, log the item's contents.

## Mission Two

The item you retrieved in Mission One should contain a top-secret passphrase. You need to post that passphrase inside another storage unit for use by another agent. Again, please observe standard console logging procedures. Some resources that you may find helpful:

## Mission Three

Agent, it's time to bring you into the loop: you are not the only operative assigned to this exploit. There are others, and they need to know that you have made it this far. Agent Batman is monitoring the storage unit at https://api.myjson.com/bins/3te1c for your signal. First, confirm that the site has not been compromised by checking the passphrase inside. Once confirmed, turn on the "signal_beam" and await further instructions.

## Bonus Mission

While you're waiting for Agent Batman's instructions, take a break from the field and put your JavaScript skills to work here at HQ. As you can see, our digital dossier display is on the blink. "Mission Status" is frozen at pending. See if you can get it up and running again, changing your the Mission Status to "In Progress", "Failed", and "Completed" at the appropriate points in each mission...
