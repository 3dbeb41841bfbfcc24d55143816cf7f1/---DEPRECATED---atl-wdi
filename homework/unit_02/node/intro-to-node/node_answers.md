# A Closer Look at npm
- Take a look at npm's [most starred packages](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/star) on the npmjs website
- Record your answers below
- Bonus points: formatting this into a table

### Note: NPM Now features "most depended-upon packages" not most starred.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3

### The 6 highest-starred npm packages are:
