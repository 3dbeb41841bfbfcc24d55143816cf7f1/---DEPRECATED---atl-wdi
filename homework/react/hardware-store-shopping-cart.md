# Hardware Store Shopping Cart

Let's add a shopping cart to our Hardware Store. Starting with the code from today's lab:

* Create a CartView component that displays all of the items in our cart.
* Within ShopView, add a `Add to Cart` button that will add an item to the shopping cart
* For each Product in our cart, show a button that allows us to remove the product from the cart.

* **BONUS: If an item already exists in the cart, add a "quantity" display and increment it when "Add To Cart" is clicked again.**

# Turning In

* Create a new Git repository with your solution.
* Submit a link to the Git repository on Schoology.
