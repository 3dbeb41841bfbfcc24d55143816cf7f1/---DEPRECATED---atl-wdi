### Post answers (and links to where you found them) for each of the questions below:

1. Can we use `npm` with React or do we have to use `yarn`?

https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html

You can use either.

2. We are using JSX to write HTML inside of our React. Are we required to use JSX with React? Are there any alternatives?

https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

You can use regular ES6 syntax, but why would you?

3. Does React re-render the entire component when one part of it changes?

https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html

No, it only changes the parts of the component that need to change.

4. Should we ever change `props` (or parameters) inside of a component? 

https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

No, React components are like pure functions,  the props are immutable. 

5. Are all components classes? 

https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html

No, they can also just be functions.
