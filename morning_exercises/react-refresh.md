# React Refresh!

It's been a few weeks since the last time we built a UI using React.  This morning, use `create-react-app` to build a basic ToDo list.

Requirements:
  - Iterate through a list of JSON data and show the todo in the browser.
  - Wire up an input to add a todo item to the list.
  - Add a checkbox that a user can click once a todo is finished to remove it from the list.

Stretch Goals:
  - When clicking on a todo item, the user is navigated to a `show` page.
  - Use `styled-components` to style the todo list.
