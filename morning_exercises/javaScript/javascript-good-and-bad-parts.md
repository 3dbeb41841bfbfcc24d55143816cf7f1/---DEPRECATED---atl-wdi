## Morning Exercise - Javascript: Good and Bad Parts

- Watch this video from Gary Bernhardt: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat
- Then read the Preface and Chapters 1 and 2 of this book: http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf
- Then read this appendix for the same book: http://archive.oreilly.com/pub/a/javascript/excerpts/javascript-good-parts/bad-parts.html

### Discuss with a partner:
- What is one "bad part" of Javascript?
- What is one "good part" of Javascript?
- Why would we continue to use a language that has so many "bad parts?"
- Do you think all programming languages have these same kinds of trade-offs?
